Data Structures and Operations on Them

In this laboratory work, I chose to implement a data structure, and more specifically - a linked list.

Firstly, I implemented the linked list and made it possible to create it by adding node by node, as I consider it is the most clear and concise way to do it. I added an interactive menu,with multiple options to choose from for the user. There were listed the actions the user can tale, as well as the option to exit the program completely. 

I added the possibility to create a linked list from the keyboard and save it in a file, as well as loading an alreadys saved linked list from a file and displayimg it in the terminal.Additionally, I added a few other operations to perfom on linked lists: append ( add a new node/element at the beginning of the list), prepend ( add a new node/element at the end of the list), adding a value to a specific index indicated by the user, removing a value from a specific index of the list indicated by the user.

All these operations can be performed on linked lists loaded from files and can be saved back in files as well.

At the end, I saved everything and pushed the code ( and soem otehr relevant files to the project) to my github remote repository by using git.
